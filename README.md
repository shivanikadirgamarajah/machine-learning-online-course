# machine-learning-online-course

This project is a simple neural network built from scratch using only Python’s `math` and `random` modules. It was created as part of a course that awarded a certificate upon completion.

## What It Does

- Initializes random weights
- Trains on a small dataset using a sigmoid function
- Adjusts weights with basic backpropagation
- Predicts output for new input

## Files

- `neural_network.py` – Source code
- `certificate.pdf` – Course completion certificate
- `README.md` – Project overview

## Notes
This code was for a certificate course and demonstrates foundational concepts in neural networks.
